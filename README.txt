This project contains an interaktive biology simulation. The goal of this simulation is to 
create a functional ecosystem based on different creatures (e.g. gras, trees, cows, fish, tigers).
The user can choose from a list of given creatures and place them on a virtual, randomly 
generated environment. During the simulation the creatures behave according to a simple AI. 
For example, plants only reproduce if there are enough plants of the same species in their 
neighborhood. Animals can wander around and rest afterwards or search for food in case they are 
hungry. Finally, a restricted lifetime requires them to search for a breeding mate.

This project was part of the 'Bachelor-Praktikum' course at the University of Bayreuth in 2017.
